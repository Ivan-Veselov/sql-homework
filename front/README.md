# Frontend 

## How to build

npm manager is required.
See [get npm link](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

After npm install simply run:

`npm install`

It will create node_modules directory and lots of libraries there.
After downloading libraries we need to build React scripts by:

`webpack`

It will create build directory with generated javascript.

## Launch

Just open index.html in your browser and enjoy!
